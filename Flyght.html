                <h3><span>1</span>What to pack in the suitcase?</h3>
                <p>If you travel to London, it is essential to bring some coat, even if you have planned your trip in
                    summer, because at
                    night it usually cools a lot. In addition, you should not forget an umbrella or a raincoat, since rains
                    are quite common
                    in this destination. We also recommend you bring a first aid kit (remember that in some countries to buy
                    the medicines
                    sold here without a prescription, they can only be purchased with a prescription). For example,
                    Ibuprofen pills are much
                    smaller than those found in Spain. Considering these basic notions, let's move on to preparing the
                    luggage.</p>

                <p>
                    In addition, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Colombia establishes that those minors who are in need
                of traveling
                alone, without one of their parents or with a third person, must have an exit permit from the country.</p>
