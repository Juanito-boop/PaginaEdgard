                    <h3><span>1</span>What to pack in the suitcase?</h3>
                    <p>If you travel to London, it is essential to bring some coat, even if you have planned your trip in
                        summer, because at
                        night it usually cools a lot. In addition, you should not forget an umbrella or a raincoat, since rains
                        are quite common
                        in this destination. We also recommend you bring a first aid kit (remember that in some countries to buy
                        the medicines
                        sold here without a prescription, they can only be purchased with a prescription). For example,
                        Ibuprofen pills are much
                        smaller than those found in Spain. Considering these basic notions, let's move on to preparing the
                        luggage.</p>

                        <p>Regardless of whether you are vaccinated for Covid-19, as outlined by the Department for Transport and
                            the Department of
                            Health and Social Care of the United Kingdom, to travel to England it is not necessary to book and pay
                            for a Covid-19
                            test. You also won't have to fill out a passenger locator form and you won't be quarantined when you
                            arrive in the
                            country.</p>
